%%%%%%%%%% TRADITIONAL CONCLUSIONS %%%%%%%%%%  
Vascular malformations are a class of lesion that are both phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. Despite this heterogeneity, they share an overarching pathogenic mechanism whereby the initial formation of a lesion is seeded by a somatic mutation. These mutations may be in genes involved in canonical vascular development and maintenance or may be in well characterized oncogenes; nonetheless, somatic mutations play an integral role in the pathogenesis of many---if not all---vascular malformations. The studies described herein were performed with the goal of broadening our understanding of how somatic mutations may contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular malformations. Specifically, I aimed to show that somatic mutations may drive three distinct phases in the pathogenesis of vascular malformations: initiation (Chapter 2), progression (Chapter 3), and predisposition (Chapter 4). 

The role of somatic mutations in the initiation of vascular malformations is widely accepted and relatively well studied, however the vascular malformations associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) remained one of the few VM disorders for which the contribution of somatic mutations remained unclear. Theories persisted for decades that telangiectasia and visceral AVMs in HHT were due to somatic mutations in a Knutsonian two-hit mechanism; however, due to a combination of tissue rarity and the limitations of sequencing technology, the theory remained untested. We were able to acquire punch biopsies of telangiectasia from individuals with HHT to test this hypothesis using next-generation sequencing and I was successfully able to show that the telangiectasia in HHT follow a two-hit mechanism. Notably, I only found two-hit somatic mutations in 9 of 19 telangiectasia suggesting there may be additional mutations that we missed in this study which will be further discussed in the following section. This finding fills a critical gap in our understanding of the genetics of HHT and adds to the growing list of VM disorders that are caused by somatic mutations. 

The somatic mutations identified in vascular malformations to date have been monogenic. In my studies of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) I found that CCMs often develop via digenic somatic mutations. Similar to what I showed for HHT, CCMs have been known to develop via a two-hit mechanism caused by somatic mutations in either \italicize{KRIT1}, \italicize{CCM2}, or \italicize{PDCD10}. In Chapter 3, I found that many CCMs harbored a somatic gain of function mutation in \italicize{PIK3CA} \italicize{in addition} to the previously described somatic mutations. In these CCMs, we have found as many as 3 distinct somatic mutations in a single lesion and I further showed that these mutations are all present in the same population of cells. Work from our collaborators, Aileen Ren and Mark Kahn, showed a potent synergistic effect of biallelic LOF in \italicize{KRIT1} and GOF in \italicize{PIK3CA} where either genotype alone only confers a modest vascular phenotype. These data suggest that CCMs that formed via biallelic LOF in a CCM gene may acquire a somatic mutation in \italicize{PIK3CA} that may induce lesion progression years after the initial lesion forms. This finding accounts for the clinical observations of rapid growth of CCMs that have been quiescent for years and also account for the significant intra-individual variability of lesions in familial CCM. This finding constitutes the first evidence of a digenic, three-hit mechanism, and suggests that secondary somatic mutations in vascular malformations may drive lesion progression after their initial formation. To date, this remains the only study where secondary somatic mutations have been identified in a vascular malformation, however future studies may find that this is a general mechanism of VM pathogenesis. 

My finding that as many as 3 different somatic mutations could co-exist in a single sporadic CCM came as a surprise. There are numerous clinical cases of CCM of sporadic CCMs developing later in adulthood; a period where our mouse models suggest that CCMs cannot form from biallelic LOF in a CCM or \italicize{PIK3CA} GOF alone. This suggests that these cases must acquire 3 specific somatic mutations without forming an intermediate CCM---i.e. all 3 mutations must \italicize{occur} in an individual cell. This series of events is extremely unlikely so I explored alternate hypotheses that may predispose to sporadic CCM formation. Previous studies of genetic predisposition to CCM have focused on germline variation, however I hypothesized that a benign somatic mosaic structure in the brain may predispose to sporadic CCM formation; specifically, developmental venous anomalies (DVA). DVA are the most common vascular malformation present in up to 16\% of the general population, and are generally considered to be benign. Nearly all sporadic CCM directly abut a DVA, however the cause of this association has remained a mystery. I showed that DVA and the adjacent CCM harbor a shared somatic GOF mutation in \italicize{PIK3CA}, however the DVA lacks the \italicize{MAP3K3} mutation present in the adjacent CCM. This shows that DVA function as an intermediate lesion, effectively predisposing to sporadic CCM formation. This highlights DVA as a potential risk factor in CCM development and future studies may find that the \italicize{PIK3CA} mutation in DVA may predispose to the formation of other \italicize{PIK3CA}-mutated diseases.

Together, the studies presented herein suggest that somatic mutations may play a wider role in the pathogenesis of vascular malformations than previously appreciated. My research into the novel roles of somatic mutations has been focused on CCMs, however future studies of other vascular malformations may find additional somatic mutations that drive various aspects of their pathogenesis. 

In the following sections I will discuss several open lines of inquiry, potential future directions, and assorted hypotheses related to the pathogenesis of vascular malformations.

\section{Missing Mutations}
One important open question across my studies is the mutation status of lesions where I did not identify somatic mutations. In Chapter 2, I did not find a somatic mutation in 10 of 19 telangiectasia. In Chapters 3 and 4, I did not find causal somatic mutations (CCM genes or \italicize{MAP3K3}) in 25 of 51 sporadic CCMs and 10 of 20 familial CCMs. It is possible that these lesions have mutations in other genes that we did not sequence; however, I believe it is more likely that these lesions harbor mutations that cannot be detected by my sequencing method. Throughout these studies I used targeted short-read sequencing for mutation discovery. This method is extremely powerful for detecting single nucleotide variants and relatively small insertions or deletions, but is unable to detect all possible types of somatic loss of function mutations. In this section I will discuss two types of mutation that may result in loss of function, but are not detectable by traditional short-read sequencing approaches: somatic hypermethylation, and somatic loss of heterozygosity. 

\subsection{Somatic Hypermethylation}
Cytosine methylation occurs at CpG dinucleotides and results in the addition of a methyl group \italicize{ortho} to the amine of cytosine.  Methylation of cytosines in the promotor region of a gene is a well established regulatory mark that results in decreased expression. In cancer, increased methylation (or hypermethylation) in the promotor of a tumor suppressor gene is a common and effective method of gene silencing as reviewed here \citep{baylin2005}. Similar to cancer, it is possible that somatic hypermethylation in the promotors of causal genes in HHT or CCM may result in silencing---and therefore LOF---which would be invisible to traditional sequencing.

I attempted to detect somatic hypermethylation events in mutation-negative telangiectasia using targeted bisulfite sequencing. Bisulfite treatment of DNA converts any unmethylated cytosines to uracil via deamination such that any cytosines in the sequencing reads can be identified as methylated (Figure~\ref{Somatic_Hypermethylation}).

Wild type DNA should have low levels of methylation and a long tail representing inefficiencies in the bisulfite conversion and sequencing errors (top right). In contrast, a sample with somatic hypermethylation should have a similar distribution to wild type DNA, but is expected to have a secondary peak representing reads with heavy methylation (bottom right).}

\section{CCM \& Meningioma}
Although the vascular lesions are the primary sequelae of familial CCM, many groups have noted an increased prevalence of meningioma in individuals with familial CCM---especially those with a mutation in \italicize{PDCD10} \citep{labauge2009, riant2013, garaci2015}. In addition, we have previously been contacted by an individual whose child had a sporadic CCM that regrew into a meningioma. Unfortunately we were unable to acquire a tissue sample for genetic analysis, however this case along with the strong link between familial CCM and meningioma has fueled my interest in understanding the link between CCM and meningioma. 

\subsection{Kruppel-like factor 4 (\italicize{KLF4})}
\italicize{KLF4} is a transcription factor with key roles in the pathogenesis of both CCM and meningioma. In CCM, \italicize{KLF4} (along with \italicize{KLF2}) is a key player in CCM signaling that is upregulated by loss of the CCM complex or gain of function in \italicize{MAP3K3} \citep{cuttano2016, zhou2016}. Indeed, overexpression of \italicize{KLF4} in mouse models leads to an aggressive CCM-like phenotype \citep{ren2021}. In meningioma, mutations in \italicize{KLF4} are common and often co-occur with mutations in \italicize{TRAF7} \citep{reuss2013}. In addition, \italicize{KLF4} mutated meningioma have been shown to be responsive to treatment with temsirolimus \citep{vonSpreckelsen2020}—a derivative of rapamycin (sirolimus) which has been shown to be effective in treating CCM in mice \citep{ren2021}. The importance of \italicize{KLF4} in both CCM and meningioma suggests that dysregulation of \italicize{KLF4} may underlie the development of meningioma in individuals with familial CCM. 

The majority of \italicize{KLF4} mutations found in the catalog of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC) result in p.K409Q (Figure~\ref{KLF4_COSMIC}A). This narrow spectrum of mutations suggests that the p.K409Q variant results in KLF4 gain of function. Notably, the p.K409Q mutation is highly specific to meningioma, occurring in very few other cancer types (Figure~\ref{KLF4_COSMIC}B). The KLF4 protein contains 3 DNA-binding zinc-finger domains that contribute to its activity as a transcription factor. The p.K409Q mutation occurs in the first of the three zinc-finger domains (Figure~\ref{KLF4_COSMIC}C). A structural study of KLF4 determined that the second two zinc-finger domains consistently bind DNA, however the first zinc-finger only sometimes participates in DNA binding \citep{schuetz2011}. They determined that the second and third domains are required for site specificity, but the third "inhibits cryptic self-renewal and block of differentiation activity". This immediately suggests a mechanism by which the p.K409Q mutation may disrupt the inhibitory capacity of KLF4 while retaining its functions that are independent of the first zinc-finger domain.

I though that since overexpression of \italicize{KLF4} is sufficient to cause CCM in mice, the p.K409Q mutation may cause some sporadic CCMs in humans. To test this, I developed a ddPCR assay to test for this mutation in 30 mutation-negative sporadic CCM, however I did not find evidence for this mutation in any of these samples. This may be a reflection of the highly specific functions of the first zinc-finger domain in KLF4 as discussed above. This function may be critical for meningioma development, but less important for CCM development. However, the inverse is not necessarily true---i.e.~while the p.K409Q mutation may not cause CCMs, overexpression of \italicize{KLF4} may cause meningioma. This is currently unknown, though if true, may account for the presence of meningioma in familial CCM. One straightforward way to test this hypothesis would be to sequence tissue from meningioma in individuals with familial CCM. I suspect that these meningioma harbor a somatic loss of function mutation in \italicize{KRIT1/CCM2/PDCD10} leading to biallelic loss of a CCM gene resulting in upregulation of \italicize{KLF4}. These meningioma may also harbor a second mutation in \italicize{TRAF7} which have often been found in non-CCM meningioma. Unfortunately, tissue samples of meningioma from individuals with familial CCM have been difficult to acquire, thus I have been unable to test this hypothesis. However, I expect that future studies will find that \italicize{KLF4} is a critical link between CCM and meningioma.

\section{Somatic Mutations in Infantile Hemangioma}
Infantile hemangioma (IH) are one of the most common vascular malformations. They occur in children and are typically present at birth as a red spot flush with the surrounding skin. Soon after birth the hemangioma rapidly grows and becomes raised from the skin. They are generally benign and are typically left alone unless they cover the child's mouth, nose, or eyes. What makes IH so interesting compared to other types of vascular malformations is that they almost always completely regress within the first few years of the child's life. While other types of vascular malformations may spontaneously regress (telangiectasia and AVMs), none do so with the consistency of IH. This phenomenon has been of great interest, not for the purpose of developing therapeutics for IH (propranolol is an extremely effective treatment for IH) but for uncovering the mechanism of regression in the hopes that what we learn can be applied to regress other, more nefarious, vascular malformations. 

\subsection{GLUT1 in IH endothelium}
Perhaps one of the most provocative discoveries into the mechanism of IH pathogenesis is the fact that endothelial cells from IHs highly express GLUT1 \citep{north2000, north2001}. GLUT1 is a glucose transporter that has remarkable specificity for the placental endothelium. This finding suggested that the IH may be comprised of cells that dislodged from the maternal placenta, then became hyper-proliferative in a post-fetal environment. If this hypothesis is correct, one would expect to find that the IH is a genetically chimeric growth between fetal and maternal cells. This hypothesis was put to the test using fluorescence \italicize{in situ} hybridization to assay the presence of XX cells in IH from a male infant with confirmation by sequencing microsatellites and SNPs that were divergent between mother and child. This analysis found no evidence for maternal-fetal chimerism in IH \citep{pittman2006}. Despite this counter-evidence, the presence of GLUT1 in IH is strongly indicative of some link with the placenta though unfortunately this link currently remains elusive. The current literature has very clearly shown the presence of GLUT1 in IH endothelial cells, however the extent of the placental transcriptional program is unclear. Epigenomic profiling of paired IH and maternal placental samples may give valuable insights into the mechanism of IH. 

\subsection{Efforts to find somatic mutations in IH}
As it is quickly becoming clear that the vast majority of vascular malformations are the result of somatic mutations—many occurring in known oncogenes—I thought that somatic mutations may also underlie IH. To test this, I sequenced 61 IH lesions on an 'oncopanel' covering many genes that are highly mutated in cancers as well as several genes previously implicated in vascular malformations (\italicize{KRIT1, CCM2, PDCD10, ACVRL1, ENG, SMAD4,} etc.) Unfortunately after filtering putative variants, no there were no variants with likely functional significance and that occurred in more than a single sample. I am aware of at least 1 other group that has attempted to identify somatic mutations in IH via whole-exome sequencing, however to date there are no known somatic mutations in IH. One important aspect of these studies that must be noted is that they are invariably focused on coding regions of the genome. Non-coding variants are more than capable of causing disease however discovery-focused sequencing studies often ignore non-coding regions both because of the cost of sequencing the entire genome to a depth sufficient to detect somatic mutations, and the challenges associated with functional analysis of non-coding variants. Further studies may find that somatic mutations do cause IH, but they occur in a region of the genome that is missed by the majority of sequencing studies.
