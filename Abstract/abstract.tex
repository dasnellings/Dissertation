Vascular malformations are a diverse class of focal lesions that may occur throughout the body and affect different vascular beds (e.g. arteries, veins, capillaries). Distinct from cancer, vascular malformations remain functional structures and lack the capacity for metastasis and uncontrolled growth. Despite their differences, vascular malformations and cancer share an underlying pathogenic mechanism: somatic mutations. The majority of somatic mutations in vascular malformations cause gain of function (GOF) in genes involved in vascular development and/or general proliferation (e.g. \italicize{TEK}, \italicize{PIK3CA}, \italicize{KRAS}). Conversely, some vascular malformations such as CCM and CM-AVM are caused by loss of function (LOF) somatic mutations.
